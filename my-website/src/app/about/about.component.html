        Welcome to my website :3<br>
        I have created this as an SoC Project but might work on it further <br>
        and make it my official personal websites(quite an oxymoron there huh)

        <h3><u>ABOUT</u></h3>
        Hi! My name is Sandeepan Naskar (Literally written in gigantic font at the top).<br>
        I am currently doing my undergraduate degree at IIT Bombay.<br>
        Iâ€™m pursuing a B.Tech with CSE as my major.<br>
        And well I am one of those students who didn't really know how to code and then acquired a taste along the way.<br>
        Its been a year since I first learnt to type code outside notepad and <i>look dad I am making a website now</i> lol.<br>
        You can find me anyday just sitting in front of my laptop procrastinating like a pro.
        <br><br>
        Here's a meme with me in it :)<br>

        <h3 style="color:#314238;"><u>Academic Interests</u></h3>
        Owing to the curiosity and drive to explain things around me, I fell in love with Physics<br>
        and I continued to feel that way in my school days and my JEE preparations and then...<br><br>
        Oh nevermind just look at this video this kind of explains how I feel<br>

        But now then I still do love certain aspects of the subject, especially, Astrophysics and alongwith it <br>
        Astronomy which always has amazed me and now yay I am a "volunteer" at IITB's Astro Club.

        <h3 style="color:#314238;"><u>Anime/Manga/Shows</u></h3>
        So starting off, I love manga/anime. And unlike many weebs, One Piece is my favourite.<br>
        (Yeah I know it's 1000+ chapters long but I love it <i>and</i> it was the first manga I read :D)<br>
        So if you are here for anime suggestions, these are some must watch/read:-<br>
        1. Deathnote <br>
        2. Code Geass <br>
        3. Attack on Titan<br>
        These were some short masterpieces for beginners.<br>
        4. Naruto<br>
        5. One Piece<br>
        These were some long classics and are more of an acquired taste.<br>
        By the way these are not ranked in any order, I love them all.<br>
        Wholesome anime Honourable mention (Assassination Classroom)<br><br><br>
        Here's the infamous potato chip scene from Deathnote XD<br>

        <br><br><br>
        As popular opinion goes that anime watchers don't indulge in "normal" web series, well I tend to be that way<br>
        but I have watched FRIENDS, Game of Thrones and Community and loved all three :D
