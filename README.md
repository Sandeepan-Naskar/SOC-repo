SoC-Intro to WebDev
### Report of Stuff learnt so far:
- As a part of the **selection process** we were made to do an **assignment** which required us to design a webpage which contained a few components which I had previously not known about. A few of those things that I learnt were:
  -  **Special characters** that can be used for indentation of text like `&nbsp;`, `&emsp;` and `&ensp;`, and HTML **Symbols** like `&#169;` used for Copyright.
  -  I also learnt about the **progress bar** along with usage of the `<progress value="" max=""></progress>` tag. 
  -  It also required that I am aware of the `<details></details>` and the `<summary></summary>` tags.
- **Assignment-1** also required learning of a few other html elements and coding style as following:
  - The importance of **comments** as initially my code didn't have proper comments initially.
  - The importance of the `<meta http-equiv="" content="">` tag. 
  - Learning to fade in and fade out text by changing opacity gradually using **JavaScript**.
  - Creating a **responsive Window/Web page** by using `vw` and `vh`. 
  - The `<label></label>` tag and the `<input></input>` tag with `type="text"`, `"password"` and `"submit"`.
  - Creating an unorderded list with **customised bullets**.
