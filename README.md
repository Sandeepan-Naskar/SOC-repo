# SOC-repo
SoC-Intro to WebDev
### Report of Stuff learnt so far:

- As a part of the **selection process** we were made to do an **assignment** which required us to design a webpage which contained a few components which I had previously not known about. A few of those things that I learnt were:
  -  **Special characters** that can be used for indentation of text like `&nbsp;`, `&emsp;` and `&ensp;`, and HTML **Symbols** like `&#169;` used for Copyright.
  -  I also learnt about the **progress bar** along with usage of the `<progress value="" max=""></progress>` tag. 
  -  It also required that I am aware of the `<details></details>` and the `<summary></summary>` tags.
  -  ***soc.html*** in this repository contains the html code.

- **Assignment-1** also required learning of a few other html elements and coding style as following:
  - The importance of **comments** as my code didn't have proper comments initially.
  - The importance of the `<meta http-equiv="" content="">` tag. 
  - Learning to fade in and fade out text by changing opacity gradually using **JavaScript**.
  - Creating a **responsive Window/Web page** by using `vw` and `vh`. 
  - The `<label></label>` tag and the `<input></input>` tag with `type="text"`, `"password"` and `"submit"`.
  - Creating an unorderded list with **customised bullets**.

- **Assignment-2** was based mainly on JavaScript and CSS and the things I learnt are:
  - Creating the toggle button using multiple concepts in CSS and functions in JS.
  - Creating the login and logout buttons using functions in JS.
  - Adding HTML code in JS like `document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "<tag> HTML code </tag>";`
  - Adding date using `Date()`
  - Changing style of the body by accessing a class for dark mode by using `document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");`
  - Final website link that combines the work of Assignment 1 and 2 is *https://jsfiddle.net/vayhgjck/* and the code is in ***Assignment(1-2).html*** file in this repository.

/*This assignment, i.e., Assignment-3 has not been uploaded in the repository as the Checkpoints required only 3 submissions and I have posted the next one as my work*/
- **Assignment-3** was based on creating an Angular Project where I learnt: 
  - The separation of HTML and CSS and parts of the webpage can be oragnised into components.
  - The inclusion of JavaScript code into the webpage which isn't the default language used(TypeScript).
  - The modification of *app.module.ts* in order to get the components linked and passing their respective tags appropriately. 
  - Learning various components that can be used in a webpage for example footer, sidebar, menu, etc.

- **Final Assignment- Portfolio Website** was to use all learned so far along with a bit of PHP(backend) if required:
  - Here's the link to the website that I hosted on bighome *http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~200050126/*
  - During the making of the website I learnt PHP syntax and it's various applications mostly form w3schools just like in previous assignments.
  - Learnt the usage of `<iframe></iframe>` tag to directly embed youtube videos.
  - Used an image from the *assets folder* in my Angular project but bighome supported a single html file webpage hence had to add a dropbox link.
  - Had failed to connect my backend to a database I created using a xampp server and hence removed the code in the final ***index.html*** file hosted on bighome.

### Assignment/Problem Statements
- Parts of the webpage are:-
  - SECTION 1: Header containing your Name in the *biggest possible heading*.
  - SECTION 2: Four links *that open https://www.wncc-iitb.org/ in a new tab on clicking.*
  - SECTION 3: *second largest heading* along with *square* bullet contents.
  - SECTION 4: *third-largest heading* along with *Progress bar*.
  - SECTION 5: *third-largest heading* along with a *drop-down type label* which, *when clicked, shows the details.*
  - SECTION 6: Footer containing an image(http://www.intro-webdesign.com/images/newlogo.png) and the text with the link (https://www.wncc-iitb.org/) shown in the screenshot.At last right-sided copyright mark with your name. All *unvisited links are blue in colour, and visited links are green in colour.* You are free to replace any text/image in the webpage with text/image of your choice.

- Assignment-1:-
  - **Problem 1**- Replicate the internet.iitb.ac.in page (You can access it through VPN). I have attached the screenshot of the page.
  Submit in editor "https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default" using internal CSS only. Try to be as close to the original page as possible.
  - **Problem 2**- Make a webpage containing your profile. You can visit "http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~190040100/"  to see mine (It's a basic webpage, I didn't get enough time to make it responsive for some screen size. I will update it in a few days. So it is suggested to view it on a laptop for now). Use as many tags and properties as you can to make it attractive. 
  *However, you don't have to submit problem 2 in your first assignment. This is solely for you to show some creativity :-). You can submit it to me whenever you want.*

- Assignment-2:-
  - **Problem 1**- In the last assignment's problem 1 add features of night mode or any theme of your choice such that clicking on that changes the colour/background/ theme of the webpage. Also, validate the webpage such that only roll number between 200000000 to 202000000 can log in to the page. (no restriction on password as we are not working with backend). For all such valid login convert the page to only show login date & time and username and having a logout button which when clicked bring back to the original page. (The second page should also have options of night mode or other themes).
  *Note:- To change the theme add a toggle button. I have attached the SS of the button.*
  - **Problem 2**- Update your webpage with the application of JavaScript and media queries. Try to add as many effects/ transitions as you can to make it attractive. *However, you don't need to submit this problem (problem 2) in your current assignment but please keep updating it as I will ask for it in the end.*

- Assignment-3:- Create a website using Angular.

- Final Assignment:- Create a portflolio website of your own.

#### So the project is officially over I suppose and above is the list of new things I took away from it and I would like further my work on the webpages I have made in order to explore the domains I have touched upon with the help of my mentor.
