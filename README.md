# SOC-repo
SoC-Intro to WebDev
### Report of Stuff learnt so far:

- As a part of the **selection process** we were made to do an **assignment** which required us to design a webpage which contained a few components which I had previously not known about. A few of those things that I learnt were:
  -  **Special characters** that can be used for indentation of text like `&nbsp;`, `&emsp;` and `&ensp;`, and HTML **Symbols** like `&#169;` used for Copyright.
  -  I also learnt about the **progress bar** along with usage of the `<progress value="" max=""></progress>` tag. 
  -  It also required that I am aware of the `<details></details>` and the `<summary></summary>` tags.

- **Assignment-1** also required learning of a few other html elements and coding style as following:
  - The importance of **comments** as my code didn't have proper comments initially.
  - The importance of the `<meta http-equiv="" content="">` tag. 
  - Learning to fade in and fade out text by changing opacity gradually using **JavaScript**.
  - Creating a **responsive Window/Web page** by using `vw` and `vh`. 
  - The `<label></label>` tag and the `<input></input>` tag with `type="text"`, `"password"` and `"submit"`.
  - Creating an unorderded list with **customised bullets**.

- **Assignment-2** was based mainly on JavaScript and CSS and the things I learnt are:
  - Creating the toggle button using multiple concepts in CSS and functions in JS.
  - Creating the login and logout buttons using functions in JS.
  - Adding HTML code in JS like `document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "<tag> HTML code </tag>";`
  - Adding date using `Date()`
  - Changing style of the body by accessing a class for dark mode by using `document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");`

/*This assignment, i.e., Assignment-3 has not been uploaded in the repository as the Checkpoints required only 3 and I have posted the next one*/
- **Assignment-3** was based on creating an Angular Project where I learnt: 
  - The separation of HTML and CSS and parts of the webpage can be oragnised into components.
  - The inclusion of JavaScript code into the webpage which isn't the default language used(TypeScript).
  - The modification of *app.module.ts* in order to get the components linked and passing their respective tags appropriately. 
  - Learning various components that can be used in a webpage for example footer, sidebar, menu, etc.

- **Final Assignment- Portfolio Website** was to use all learned so far along with a bit of PHP(backend) if required:
  - Here's the link to the website that I hosted on bighome *http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~200050126/*
  - During the making of the website I learnt PHP syntax and it's various applications mostly form w3schools just like in previous assignments.
  - Learnt the usage of `<iframe></iframe>` tag to directly embed youtube videos.
  - Used an image from the *assets folder* in my Angular project but bighome supported a single html file webpage hence had to add a dropbox link.
  - Had failed to connect my backend to a database I created using a xampp server and hence removed the code in the final *index.html* file hosted on bighome.
